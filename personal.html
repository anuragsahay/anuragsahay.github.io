<h1>Personal Interests</h1>
</div>
<p>This page documents my personal interests.</p>
<p>I read voraciously, and I particularly like reading comic books, fantasy novels and science fiction. I also indulge in recreational crosswords, board games, movies and television and have a layman's interest in history and mythology.</p>
<h2>Clubs</h2>
<p>I was a member of the following clubs at DPSRKP:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Mathematical Society</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Quizzing Society</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was a member of the following clubs and hobby groups at IITK:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>English Literary Society (ELS) </p>
</li>
<li><p>Quiz Club (QC)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Debate and Discussion Society</p>
</li>
<li><p>Card and Board Games Club (CBG)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Science Coffeehouse</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/yahasgaruna/posts/10152677116931285" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>This post</a> gives a rough idea of the kind of books I am interested in. Currently, I am hugely into the works of Becky Chambers (<i>Wayfarers</i>, <i>To Be Taught If Fortunate</i>), Max Gladstone (<i>The Craft Sequence</i>, <i>Bookburners</i>, <i>This Is How You Lose The Time War</i>), N.K. Jemisin (<i>The Inheritance Trilogy</i>, <i>The Broken Earth Trilogy</i>), and  Brandon Sanderson (<i>The Cosmere Sequence</i>, including <i>Mistborn</i>, <i>Warbreaker</i> and <i>The Stormlight Archive</i>). About a year ago, I also fell in love with <i>The Vorkosigan Saga</i> by Lois McMaster Bujold. </p>
<p>While epic fantasy doorstoppers are my first love, I've recently started a foray into fantasy novellas and short novels, especially those published by <a href="https://publishing.tor.com" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Tor.com publishing</a>.</p>
<p>I was also a major fan of the Star Wars Expanded Universe (now known as Star Wars: Legends). Grand Admiral Thrawn is my favourite Star Wars character, Timothy Zahn is my favourite Star Wars writer and Luke Skywalker+Mara Jade is my <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>OTP</a>. As far as I'm concerned, if Mara no longer exists in the newfangled Disney canon, then the newfangled Disney canon does not exist for me. (Okay, maybe that's not precisely true&hellip;)</p>
<p>I love comic books, though I now largely consume them through adaptations only. My favourite comic book run is Geoff Johns and Peter Tomasi's on Green Lantern; <i>Green Lantern: Rebirth</i> was one of my two gateways into superhero comics. The other gateway comic was Jeph Loeb's run on <i>Superman/Batman</i>. My favourite mini-series is probably Grant Morrison's <i>All-Star Superman</i>. In general, I'm a DC guy, but I really adored Greg Pak's run on <i>The Incredible Hercules</i> (a Marvel publication). If I get to see a cinematic adaptation of <i>JLA/Avengers</i>, I will die a man satisfied with his life.</p>
<p>In recent times (especially since the release of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>), I've been reconsidering my loyalty to DC.</p>
<p>My favourite book series of all time is <i>The Wheel of Time</i>, by Robert Jordan, though my favourite author is probably Isaac Asimov. The question of which is my favourite book is much more difficult to answer so I'm not going to attempt to do it; however, <i>Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch</i> by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman is probably up there somewhere on the list (you should watch the delightful adaptation of it on Amazon Prime!).</p>
<p>The (largely complete) list of books I have read can be found on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4461369-anurag-sahay" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>my Goodreads profile</a>. It also has reviews of stories that I have read in the recent past (since 2016). Some particular reviews of books and series I really enjoyed recently are below:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Games</h2>
<p>Growing up, except for the short time I owned a PlayStation 2, the only videogames I used to play were real-time strategy games. My favourite videogame is probably Age of Mythology, and I adore the entire Age of Empires sequence. I also loved Warcraft III, and Blizzard's insistence towards no longer making Warcraft RTS games is my biggest gripe with the World of Warcraft MMORPG. I stopped playing videogames regularly around the same time I retired my PlayStation (that is, around 2008).</p>
<p>I love playing cards; in particular, I like rummy, 29 and hearts. In general, I prefer trick-taking games.</p>
<p>These days, I am really into modern boardgames. I enjoy some classics (particularly <i>Cluedo</i>, <i>Stratego</i>, <i>Risk</i> and <i>Scrabble</i>), but I mostly prefer modern Euro games, with a sprinkling of Ameritrash and a party game or two. </p>
<p>My favourite modern game is <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209418/dominion-second-edition" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><i>Dominion</i></a>; I play <a href="https://dominion.games" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>online</a> with the handle <a href="http://dominion.lauxnet.com/scavenger/?user=yahas" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>yahas</a>. I've recently started playing <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/120677/terra-mystica" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><i>Terra Mystica</i></a> on <a href="https://terra.snellman.net" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>snellman</a>, again with the handle <a href="https://terra.snellman.net/player/yahas" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>yahas</a>. I also play a bunch of other games (particularly, <i>Dice Forge</i>, <i>Kingdomino</i>, <i>Puerto Rico</i>, <i>Siam</i>, <i>7 Wonders</i>, <i>Stone Age</i>, <i>Takenoko</i>, <i>Tokaido</i>, <i>Carcassone</i>, <i>7  Wonders: Duel</i>, <i>Santorini</i>, <i>Love Letter</i>, <i>Jaipur</i> and <i>Through the Ages</i>) on <a href="https://boardgamearena.com" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Board Game Arena</a>, again, with the handle yahas. Offline, my favourite 2-player game is <i>7 Wonders: Duel</i>, my favourite social deduction game is <i>Avalon</i> and my favourite party game is <i>Codenames</i>. It's much much harder to pin down my favourite heavy game, so I won't even try - but I like <i>Scythe</i> enough to actual own it, instead of just playing other people's copies. The list of games I physically own are on my <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/user/yahas/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>BGG profile</a>.</p>
<p>I play IRL with the <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/BoardGamersOfDelhi" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Board Gamers of Delhi</a> whenever I am in Delhi.</p>
<p>One of the best games I have played, which requires no resources but people to play, is <a href="contact.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><i>Contact</i></a>.</p>
<h2>TV Shows and Movies</h2>
<p>I don't watch a lot of movies, but when I do, they're almost exclusively either adaptations from other media, or they're rom-coms. I am a big fan of the <i>Marvel Cinematic Universe</i>, and the list of the movies I keep rewatching again includes <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i> and <i>Begin Again</i>.</p>
<p>Two TV shows that had a huge impact on me as a kid were <i>Chuck</i> and <i>Psych</i>. <i>Chuck</i> is possibly single-handedly responsible for my early forays into alternate or indie rock. I was also very into cartoons (both western and anime) as a kid, some favourites include, the entire <i>DC Animated Universe</i> (particularly <i>Justice League</i>), <i>Cardcaptor Sakura</i>, <i>Digimon</i> and <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>. I really want to restart watching them (especially <i>Young Justice</i>), but I really haven't come around to it.</p>
<p>These days I don't have too much time to watch too many shows, but I really enjoyed the first few seasons of the <i>Arrowverse</i> and the Marvel Netflix TV shows.</p>
<p>One modern web television series that I absolutely adore is the <i>The Lizzie Bennet Diaries</i>. It's available for free online, and is a New Media adaptation of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>.</p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>When I was younger, I largely listened only to rock and alternate rock. I have since expanded my tastes to country, progressive rock and some pop. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juvwlEO-x2o" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><i>3 Rounds and a Sound</i></a> by Blind Pilot is my favourite alt rock song, the Coke Studio (Pakistan) rendition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a18py61_F_w" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><i>Tajdar-e-Haram</i></a> by Atif Aslam is my favourite song in a Hindustani language, A.R. Rahman is my favourite Bollywood musician, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbIAuSOQuB99D5mzvDuu1P2fKh_v6qPIe" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><i>Begin Again</i></a> is my favourite original soundtrack from a motion picture and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_MjCqQoLLA" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><i>Hey Jude</i></a> is my favourite song by the Beatles.</p>
<p>My current most listened to song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omm4d6aCR5k" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><i>The Dream Synopsis (EP Version)</i></a> by The Last Shadow Puppets.</p>
<h2>History and Mythology</h2>
<p>History and mythology are my first and second love (most likely because of the fact that they are the respective subjects of the games I played most in my childhood, namely <i>Age of Empires</i> and <i>Age of Mythology</i>). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><i>Crash Course</i></a> is a good place to start learning about these fascinating subjects.</p>
