<h1>Personal Interests</h1>
</div>
<p>This page documents my personal interests.</p>
<p>I am a voracious reader, and I especially like reading comic books, fantasy novels and science fiction. I also indulge in recreational programming, crosswords, board games, movies and television and have a layman's interest in history and mythology.</p>
<h2>Clubs</h2>
<p>I was a member of the following clubs at DPSRKP:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Mathematical Society</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Quizzing Society</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was a member of the following clubs and hobby groups at IITK:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>English Literary Society (ELS) </p>
</li>
<li><p>Quiz Club (QC)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Debate and Discussion Society</p>
</li>
<li><p>Card and Board Games (CBG) Club</p>
</li>
<li><p>Science Coffeehouse</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/yahasgaruna/posts/10152677116931285">This post</a> gives a rough idea of the kind of books I am interested in. Currently, I am hugely into the works of Jim Butcher (The Dresden Files, Codex Alera, The Cinder Spires), Max Gladstone (The Craft Sequence), Brandon Sanderson (The Cosmere Sequence, including Mistborn, Warbreaker and the Stormlight Archive). </p>
<p>I was also a major fan of the Star Wars Expanded Universe (now known as Star Wars: Legends). Grand Admiral Thrawn is my favourite Star Wars character, Timothy Zahn is my favourite Star Wars writer and Luke Skywalker+Mara Jade is my OTP. As far as I'm concerned, if Mara no longer exists in the newfangled Disney canon, then Disney canon does not exist for me. (Okay, maybe that's not precisely true&hellip;)</p>
<p>I love comic books, though I now largely consume them through adaptations only. My favourite comic book run is Geoff Johns and Peter Tomasi's on Green Lantern; <i>Green Lantern: Rebirth</i> was one of my two gateways into superhero comics. The other gateway comic was Jeph Loeb's run on <i>Superman/Batman</i>. My favourite mini-series is probably Grant Morrison's <i>All-Star Superman</i>. In general, I'm a DC guy, but I really adored Greg Pak's run on <i>The Incredible Hercules</i> (a Marvel publication). If I get to see a cinematic adaptation of <i>JLA/Avengers</i>, I will die a man satisfied with his life.</p>
<p>My favourite book series of all time is <i>The Wheel of Time</i>, by Robert Jordan, though my favourite author is probably Isaac Asimov. The question of which is my favourite book is much more difficult to answer so I'm not going to attempt to do it; however, <i>Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch</i> by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman is probably up there somewhere on the list.</p>
<p>The books I have read, as well as my reviews can be seen on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4461369-anurag-sahay">my Goodreads profile</a>.</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<p>Growing up, except for the short time I owned a PlayStation 2, the only videogames I used to play were real-time strategy games. My favourite videogame is probably Age of Mythology, and I adore the entire Age of Empires sequence. I also loved Warcraft III, and Blizzard's insistence towards no longer making Warcraft RTS games is my biggest gripe with the World of Warcraft MMORPG. I stopped playing videogames around the same time I retired my PlayStation (that is, around 2008).</p>
<p>I love playing cards; in particular, I like rummy, 29 and hearts. In general, I prefer trick-taking games, and I have recently tried to start learning bridge.</p>
<p>These days, I am really into boardgames. Some classics I enjoy include Cluedo, Stratego, Risk and Scrabble. My favourite game, currently, is Dominion; I play Dominion Online with the handles yahas - I have all the available expansion sets to play for the foreseaable future, so if you'd like to play with me, do let me know. </p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>When I was younger, I largely listened only to rock and alternate rock. I have since expanded my tastes to country, progressive rock and pop. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juvwlEO-x2o"><i>3 Rounds and a Sound</i></a> by Blind Pilot is my favourite alt rock song. The Coke Studio (Pakistan) rendition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a18py61_F_w"><i>Tajdar-e-Haram</i></a> by Atif Aslam is my favourite song in a Hindustani language. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_MjCqQoLLA"><i>Hey Jude</i></a> is my favourite song by the Beatles.</p>
<p>My current most listened to song is the Coke Studio version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw4tT7SCmaY"><i>Afreen Afreen</i></a> by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan &amp; Momina Mustehsan.</p>
<h2>History and Mythology</h2>
<p>History and mythology are my first and second love (most likely because of the fact that they are the respective subjects of the games I played most in my childhood, namely <i>Age of Empires</i> and <i>Age of Mythology</i>). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse"><i>Crash Course</i></a> is a good place to start learning about these fascinating subjects.</p>
