<h1>Students&rsquo; Senate</h1>
</div>
<p>I was associated with the <a href="http://students.iitk.ac.in/ss/home/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Students&rsquo; Senate</a> at IIT Kanpur for virtually my entire stay there. I served in the following capacities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Three terms as Senator for my (UG Y11) batch (2011-12, 2013-14, 2014-15)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Three terms as Students&rsquo; Senate nominee to the Senate Undergraduate Committee (2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15) of the Institute</p>
</li>
<li><p>Students&rsquo; Senate nominee to the Senate Students&rsquo; Affairs Committee (2014-15) and the Senate Education Policy Committee (2014-15) of the Institute</p>
</li>
<li><p>Secretary, Students&rsquo; Senate (2012-13)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Parliamentarian, Students&rsquo; Senate (2013-14)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chairperson, Students&rsquo; Senate (2014-15)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was also a member, convener, or chairperson of several ad-hoc and standing committees of the Students&rsquo; Senate, and the student member in various ad-hoc bodies constituted by the Institute, particularly committees of the (academic) Senate.</p>
<p>The archives of my time as Chairperson are <a href="http://students.iitk.ac.in/ss/home/archives/2014-15/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>here</a>. If you want a specific document related to my time in the Senate, or would like to discuss some aspect of student or academic governance at IIT Kanpur, please feel free to <a href="index.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>contact me</a>.</p>
<p>When I was Chairperson, <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/a-r-harish" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. A.R. Harish</a> was the Chief Counsellor, Students&rsquo; Gymkhana and Prof. Indranil Manna was the Patron, Students&rsquo; Gymkhana. I was succeeded by <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/shubham-atreja-585281124" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Shubham Atreja</a>, and my fellow officebearers were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhimanyu-arora-ab289879" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Abhimanyu Arora</a> (President, Students&rsquo; Gymkhana), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivendu-bhushan-58ba5772" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Shivendu Bhushan</a> (General Secretary, Science and Technology), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chirag-agrawal-b1470684" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Chirag Agrawal</a> (General Secretary, Games and Sports), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chetankgarg" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Chetan Garg</a> (General Secretary, Films and Media) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shalin-mandowara-52b8105b" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Shaleen Mandowara</a> (General Secretary, Cultural). I was a Senator in the Senates which were chaired by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-gupta-1b846b49" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Aditya Gupta</a> (2011-12), V. Srinivisan (2013-14) and myself (2014-15); I served as Parliamentarian in Srini's time. I was Secretary to the Senate chaired by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankit-bhutani-39a5b618" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Ankit Bhutani</a> (2012-13). </p>
<p>Prof. A.R. Harish was the Chairman, SSAC when I was a member of the SSAC, and Prof. Indranil Manna was the Chairman, Senate when I was a special invitee to the Senate.</p>
<p>During my time on the SUGC, I served under the Chairmanships of <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~arlal/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Arbind Lal</a> (2012-13), <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/pankaj-wahi" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Pankaj Wahi</a>/<a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~ynsingh" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Y.N. Singh</a> (2013-14) and <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/dr-d-p-mishra" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. D.P. Mishra</a> (2014-15). My personal favourite time on the SUGC was 2012-13, when the other student members of the SUGC were Aditya Gupta, Ankit Bhutani and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankur-pandey-17350035" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Ankur Pandey</a>; there was an abundance of people whose names started with A on the committee that particular year (including the Chairman and the senior-most member of the secretarial staff). I also think that Ankit, Ankur and I are probably the only trio of students who have served on the SUGC together for two consecutive years (2011-2013).</p>
