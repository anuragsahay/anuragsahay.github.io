== Books

[https://www.facebook.com/yahasgaruna/posts/10152677116931285 This post] gives a rough idea of the kind of books I am interested in. Currently, I am hugely into the works of Jim Butcher (The Dresden Files, Codex Alera, The Cinder Spires), Max Gladstone (The Craft Sequence), N.K. Jemisin (The Inheritance Trilogy, The Broken Earth Trilogy), and  Brandon Sanderson (The Cosmere Sequence, including Mistborn, Warbreaker and the Stormlight Archive). Barring epic fantasy doorstoppers, I've recently started a foray into fantasy novellas, especially those published by [https://publishing.tor.com Tor.com publishing].

I was also a major fan of the Star Wars Expanded Universe (now known as Star Wars: Legends). Grand Admiral Thrawn is my favourite Star Wars character, Timothy Zahn is my favourite Star Wars writer and Luke Skywalker+Mara Jade is my [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing OTP]. As far as I'm concerned, if Mara no longer exists in the newfangled Disney canon, then the newfangled Disney canon does not exist for me. (Okay, maybe that's not precisely true...)

I love comic books, though I now largely consume them through adaptations only. My favourite comic book run is Geoff Johns and Peter Tomasi's on Green Lantern; /Green Lantern: Rebirth/ was one of my two gateways into superhero comics. The other gateway comic was Jeph Loeb's run on /Superman\/Batman/. My favourite mini-series is probably Grant Morrison's /All-Star Superman/. In general, I'm a DC guy, but I really adored Greg Pak's run on /The Incredible Hercules/ (a Marvel publication). If I get to see a cinematic adaptation of /JLA\/Avengers/, I will die a man satisfied with his life.

My favourite book series of all time is /The Wheel of Time/, by Robert Jordan, though my favourite author is probably Isaac Asimov. The question of which is my favourite book is much more difficult to answer so I'm not going to attempt to do it; however, /Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch/ by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman is probably up there somewhere on the list.

The (largely complete) list of books I have read can be found on [https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4461369-anurag-sahay my Goodreads profile]. It also has reviews of stories that I have read in the recent past.

== Games
Growing up, except for the short time I owned a PlayStation 2, the only videogames I used to play were real-time strategy games. My favourite videogame is probably Age of Mythology, and I adore the entire Age of Empires sequence. I also loved Warcraft III, and Blizzard's insistence towards no longer making Warcraft RTS games is my biggest gripe with the World of Warcraft MMORPG. I stopped playing videogames regularly around the same time I retired my PlayStation (that is, around 2008).

I love playing cards; in particular, I like rummy, 29 and hearts. In general, I prefer trick-taking games.

These days, I am really into modern boardgames. I enjoy some classics (particularly /Cluedo/, /Stratego/, /Risk/ and /Scrabble/), but I mostly prefer modern Eurogames, with a sprinkling of Ameritrash and a party game or two. 

My favourite modern game is [https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209418/dominion-second-edition /Dominion/]; I play [https://dominion.games online] with the handle [http://dominion.lauxnet.com/scavenger/?user=yahas yahas]. I've recently started playing [https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/120677/terra-mystica /Terra Mystica/] on [https://terra.snellman.net snellman], again with the handle [https://terra.snellman.net/player/yahas yahas]. I also play a bunch of other games (particular, /Dice Forge/, /Puerto Rico/, /7 Wonders/ and /Carcassone/) on [https://boardgamearena.com Board Game Arena], again, with the handle [https://en.boardgamearena.com/'#'!player?id=84427183 yahas]. Offline, my favourite 2-player game is /7 Wonders: Duel/, my favourite social deduction game is /Avalon/ and my favourite party game is /Codenames/.

I play IRL with the [https://facebook.com/groups/BoardGamersOfDelhi Board Gamers of Delhi] and the [http://rochgamers.info Rochester Board Gaming Society].

One of the best games I have played, which requires no resources but people to play, is /Contact/.



== Music
When I was younger, I largely listened only to rock and alternate rock. I have since expanded my tastes to country, progressive rock and some pop. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juvwlEO-x2o /3 Rounds and a Sound/] by Blind Pilot is my favourite alt rock song, the Coke Studio (Pakistan) rendition of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a18py61_F_w /Tajdar-e-Haram/] by Atif Aslam is my favourite song in a Hindustani language, A.R. Rahman is my favourite Bollywood musician, [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbIAuSOQuB99D5mzvDuu1P2fKh_v6qPIe /Begin Again/] is my favourite original soundtrack from a motion picture and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_MjCqQoLLA /Hey Jude/] is my favourite song by the Beatles.

My current most listened to song is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH7bjV0Q_44 /Work Song/] by Hozier.

== History and Mythology
History and mythology are my first and second love (most likely because of the fact that they are the respective subjects of the games I played most in my childhood, namely /Age of Empires/ and /Age of Mythology/). [https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse /Crash Course/] is a good place to start learning about these fascinating subjects.
