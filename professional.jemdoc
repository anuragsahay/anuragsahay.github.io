= Professional Interests

As I haven't yet been [workex.html staffed on a case at BCG], I cannot be sure of where my professional interests lie. However, I do know that I will be more interested in the legal aspects of any case I am assigned, and that I am more inclined towards projects which have an impact on the social sector, particularly government projects.
