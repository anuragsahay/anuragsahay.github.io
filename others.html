<h3><a href="https://www.mathcamp.org">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a>, 2011 at <a href="http://www.reed.edu/">Reed College, USA</a></h3>
<p>This is a summer program in mathematics meant for motivated high school students, to expose them to undergraduate and graduate level mathematics. I attended classes in complex analysis, multivariable calculus, analysis of metric spaces, transcendental number theory, topology and Olympiad problem solving. This was easily one of the most mathematically enriching experiences in my life</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.kvpy.iisc.ernet.in/vijyoshi2014/2011/">Vijyoshi Camp</a>, 2011 at <a href="http://www.iisc.ac.in/">IISc Bangalore</a></h3>
<p>This was a week-long conference/camp for KVPY fellows, and other motivated science students. There were talks and presentations by several scientists from India and abroad in the fields of Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics.</p>
