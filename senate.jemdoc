= Students' Senate

I was associated with the [http://students.iitk.ac.in/ss/home/ Students' Senate] at IIT Kanpur for virtually my entire stay there. I served in the following capacities:

- Three terms as Senator for my (UG Y11) batch (2011-12, 2013-14, 2014-15)
- Three terms as Students' Senate nominee to the Senate Undergraduate Committee of the Institute (2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15)
- Students' Senate nominee to the Senate Students' Affairs Committee (2014-15) and the Senate Education Policy Committee (2014-15)
- Secretary, Students' Senate (2012-13)
- Parliamentarian, Students' Senate (2013-14)
- Chairperson, Students' Senate (2014-15)

I was also a member, convener, or chairperson of several ad-hoc and standing committees of the Students' Senate, and the student member in various ad-hoc bodies constituted by the Institute, particularly committees of the (academic) Senate.

The webpage I made as Parliamentarian is [http://students.iitk.ac.in/ss/home/parli/ here], and the archives of my time as Chairperson are [http://students.iitk.ac.in/ss/home/archives/2014-15/ here]. If you want a specific document related to my time in the Senate, or would like to discuss some aspect of student or academic governance at IIT Kanpur, please feel free to [index.html contact me].

When I was Chairperson, [https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/a-r-harish Prof. A.R. Harish] was the Chief Counsellor, Students' Gymkhana and Prof. Indranil Manna was the Patron, Students' Gymkhana. I was succeeded by [https://in.linkedin.com/in/shubham-atreja-585281124 Shubham Atreja], and my fellow officebearers were [https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhimanyu-arora-ab289879 Abhimanyu Arora] (President, Students' Gymkhana), [https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivendu-bhushan-58ba5772 Shivendu Bhushan] (General Secretary, Science and Technology), [https://www.linkedin.com/in/chirag-agrawal-b1470684 Chirag Agrawal] (General Secretary, Games and Sports), [https://www.linkedin.com/in/chetankgarg Chetan Garg] (General Secretary, Films and Media) and [https://www.linkedin.com/in/shalin-mandowara-52b8105b Shaleen Mandowara] (General Secretary, Cultural). I was a Senator in the Senates which were chaired by [https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-gupta-1b846b49 Aditya Gupta] (2011-12), V. Srinivisan (2013-14) and myself (2014-15); I served as Parliamentarian in Srini's time. I was Secretary to the Senate chaired by [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankit-bhutani-39a5b618 Ankit Bhutani] (2012-13). 

During my time on the SUGC, I served under the Chairmanships of [http://home.iitk.ac.in/~arlal/ Prof. Arbind Lal] (2012-13), [https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/pankaj-wahi Prof. Pankaj Wahi]/[http://home.iitk.ac.in/~ynsingh Prof. Y.N. Singh] (2013-14) and [https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/dr-d-p-mishra Prof. D.P. Mishra] (2014-15). My personal favourite time on the SUGC was 2011-12, when the other student members of the SUGC were Aditya Gupta, Ankit Bhutani and [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankur-pandey-17350035 Ankur Pandey]; there was an abundance of people whose names started with A on the committee that particular year (including the Chairman and the senior-most member of the secretarial staff). I also think that Ankit, Ankur and I are probably the only trio of students who have served on the SUGC together in two consecutive years (2011-2013).

Prof. A.R. Harish was the Chairman, SSAC when I was a member of the SSAC, and Prof. Indranil Manna was the Chairman, Senate when I was a special invitee to the Senate.

I take some measure of pride in my role in the development of some people who took up leadership roles in the Gymkhana when after me, including [https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashank-bhandari-0b32b312a Shashank Bhandari], [https://www.linkedin.com/in/praveen-honhar-893020b8 Praveen Honhar], [https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautam-p-s-342b3a97 Gautam Pratap] (who holds the dubious distinction of being the first President, Students' Gymkhana in the 21st Century, and possibly the only President ever, to never have served as Senator before they became President), and, of course, Atreja.
