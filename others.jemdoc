== Research Schools and Workshops Attended

=== [https://www.mathcamp.org Canada/USA Mathcamp], 2011 at [http://www.reed.edu/ Reed College, USA]
This is a summer program in mathematics meant for motivated high school students, to expose them to undergraduate and graduate level mathematics. I attended classes in complex analysis, multivariable calculus, analysis of metric spaces, transcendental number theory, topology and Olympiad problem solving. This was easily one of the most mathematically enriching experiences in my life

=== [http://www.kvpy.iisc.ernet.in/vijyoshi2014/2011/ Vijyoshi Camp], 2011 at [http://www.iisc.ac.in/ IISc Bangalore]
This was a week-long conference/camp for KVPY fellows, and other motivated science students. There were talks and presentations by several scientists from India and abroad in the fields of Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics.

=== [http://www.imsc.res.in/~knr/acadimsc13/ Science Academies' Lecture Workshop], 2013 at [https://www.imsc.res.in/ IMSc, Chennai]
This was a two day programme for undergraduate and postgraduate mathematics students funded by the Science Academies of India (IAS, INSA, NASI) with talks and presentations on "Aspects, Prospects and History in Mathematics" by researchers from IMSc, IIT Madras, CMI etc.

=== [https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/220 Summer School in Analytic Number Theory], 2014 at [http://www.ihes.fr/ IHES, France]
This was a fourteen day summer school for graduate and research level discussion on methods in Analytic Number Theory organized by Prof. Emmanuel Kowalski (ETH, Zurich) and Prof. Philippe Michel (EPFL, Lausanne). There were talks on the modern methods of analytic number theory, including the pretentious approach, sieve methods, theory of modular forms and associated paraphernalia, the Langlands program by active researchers in the field.
