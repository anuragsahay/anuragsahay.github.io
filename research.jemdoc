= Research Interests

My [project.html projects] give a fairly good idea of what kind of mathematics interests me.

Broadly speaking, I an interested in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory Number Theory]. Within number theory, I lean towards the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_number_theory analytic], combinatorial and elementary aspects of number theory.

I also have a tangential interest in Theoretical Computer Science, particularly Computational Complexity.
