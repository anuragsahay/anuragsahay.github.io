My [project.html projects] give a fairly good idea of what kind of mathematics interests me.

Broadly speaking, I an interested in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory Number Theory]. Part of what appeals to me is the sheer background one needs to do modern number theory. The interconnections with other fields often originally seem unrelated, although I'm not sure how unexpected people find it anymore; I certainly was very surprised the first time I learnt, say, that the distribution of prime numbers depended on the zeroes of the Riemann $\zeta$-function).

Within number theory, I lean towards the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_number_theory analytic], combinatorial and elementary aspects of number theory; I know very little about the algebraic aspects of number theory beyond the basics.

In particular, I am interested in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_number_theory additive number theory], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_number_theory multiplicative number theory] (including the theory of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function Riemann $\zeta$ function]), [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_theory sieve theory] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_combinatorics additive combinatorics]. I am also interested tangentially in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_number_theory computational] aspects of number theory, and the applications of additive combinatorics and number theory to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science theoretical computer science].
