*Summer Analyst*, May 2015---July 2015

I was a summer intern at the DB Centre office in Mumbai, and worked in the regulatory impact team. I designed an intra-net based tool using [https://www.djangoproject.com/ Django] (a Python-based web-development framework) which calculates the exposure faced by the bank against listed derivatives from a client portfolio. The exposure is calculated using the [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentexposuremethod.asp Current Exposure Method] under the ambit of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law European Union implementation] of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Accords Basel Accords]. The tool also calculated the risk-weighted assets held by the bank against the portfolio, and the corresponding [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_capital Tier I regulatory capital] to be held, to be used by Senior Management to make client pricing decisions to adequately compensate DB for the capital held aside. 

I got a full-time offer for my work here, but ended up not joining.
